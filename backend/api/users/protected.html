    <h1>Title: How User Authentication Works in a RESTful API with Express</h1>
    <div>
        <p><b>Introduction:</b>
            User authentication is a crucial component of web applications that require secure access to specific
            resources. In a RESTful API built with Express, the process of authenticating users involves several key
            steps to ensure the security and functionality of the system. This information text explains the underlying
            mechanisms of user authentication in such an environment.
            Initiating the Authentication Process:
            The process begins when a user sends a request to a specific endpoint in the RESTful API. If the requested
            operation is a login, the API will proceed with authentication.</p>
        <p><b>Password Comparison:</b>
            To authenticate the user, the system compares the hashed password stored in the database with the provided
            username and password.
            The use of password hashing, typically implemented with the bcrypt library, ensures that sensitive user data
            is securely stored.</p>
        <p><b>User Session Initialization:</b>
            Once the user's credentials are verified, the system initiates a user session.
            A unique session ID is created for the user, and this session ID is associated with the user's identity.
            To maintain the user's session across multiple interactions with the application, a cookie is generated and
            sent to the client's browser.</p>
        <p><b>Using Connect-Session-Knex:</b>
            To manage user sessions and persist them in the database, the system uses Connect-Session-Knex, a middleware
            for Express.
            This middleware stores essential session information, including the session ID, expiration date, and user
            ID, in a database.
            Storing session information in the database ensures that even if a user reloads the page or uses an
            incognito window, their session remains active and identifiable.</p>
        <p><b>Logging Out:</b>
            When a user chooses to log out, the system destroys their session.
            This means the session cookie is invalidated, and the user no longer has access to protected endpoints that
            require a valid session cookie, effectively terminating their authenticated status.</p>
        <p><b>Security Measures with Helmet:</b>
            The system employs the Helmet middleware to enhance security by implementing various HTTP headers that
            protect against common web vulnerabilities.
            Helmet helps secure the application against threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request
            forgery (CSRF), among others.</p>
        <p><b>Serving the Application:</b>
            To serve the web application, the frontend is typically built as a static build using tools like Create
            React App (CRA) with npm run build.
            The resulting static files are then integrated into the Express application, making them accessible through
            specific paths.</p>
        <p><b>Conclusion:</b>
            User authentication in a RESTful API built with Express is a multifaceted process that combines various
            tools and techniques to ensure secure and seamless user experiences. By implementing best practices, such as
            password hashing, session management, and security measures like Helmet, developers can create a robust and
            user-friendly authentication system for their applications.</p>
